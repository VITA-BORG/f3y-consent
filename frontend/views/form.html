         <p>Dear Participant,</p>
         <p>Earlier this year we invited you to complete a demographic survey to determine your eligibility to participate in a multi-year study on video game education and the transition to work for graduates of post-secondary games education programs. Based on your responses, we would like to invite you to participate in the full study.</p>
         <p>Dr. Sean Gouglas, a Professor in Media and Technology Studies at the University of Alberta, is leading this study. In this study, we will follow participants for their first three years in the workforce following graduation from a post-secondary program in a video game-related discipline. We are interested in what university experiences best help prepare students for the game industry, how new graduates negotiate the industry, and how employment practices at different games companies may support or hinder the success of entry-level employees.</p>
         <p>This study will last for 5 years and participation involves several activities. Because of the length of the commitment to participation, we ask you to review the steps of the study listed below and ensure that you are willing to participate in all mandatory components of the research before providing your consent to participate.</p>
         <div class="section-title">Components of the Study:</div>
         <p><b>Interviews</b>:&nbsp;Prior to the completion of your degree, you will be interviewed by a member of our research team. The interview should last approximately one hour, and will cover information related to your post-secondary education experiences, including whether you participated in internships or co-ops, your area of study, and the kinds of coursework and activities you undertook while in university or college. We will also discuss your career goals and any prior paid or voluntary game development experience. This part of the research study is an essential component for participation in the study, though you can choose to skip any questions you do not wish to answer.</p>
         <p>In each of the three subsequent years of the study (ie. 2024, 2025, and 2026) the research team will contact you to schedule an annual follow-up interview. This interview will last approximately one hour, and will cover information related to your professional and career developments over the past year, including successes, challenges, and your reflections on your experiences.  These interviews are essential components for participation in the study, though you can choose to skip any questions you do not wish to answer.</p>
         <p><b>Surveys</b>:&nbsp;Prior to each annual interview, you will complete a 10-minute survey that will help us prepare for your interview. These surveys will ask questions about your current employment as well as any important professional events or transitions that took place during the previous year. These interviews are essential components for participation in the study, though you can choose to skip any questions you do not wish to answer, with the exception of some key demographic questions. The data is collected through the confidential online platform REDCap, which houses its data on servers located in Canada and is subject to laws in that country as related to privacy and access to information. RedCap had been vetted and approved by the University of Alberta and, unlike commercial survey platforms (e.g., Qualtrics, Survey Monkey etc.), it does not collect any participant data (i.e. IP addresses) without their permission.</p>
         <p><b>Public Social Media Posts</b>:&nbsp; We would like to review your Twitter feed, LinkedIn profile, and ArtStation profile (where applicable) for employment-related posts and career developments so that we can be better informed about your career. While these media platforms are generally public, we would like to ensure you are aware of our intentions to review this material. You may also submit a current copy of your CV/resume as a supplement or if you do not have a social media profile. Providing these is optional for participation in the study.</p>
         <p>If you participate in the interviews and surveys but choose not to grant access to your other information, you may still remain in the study. Only the interviews and surveys are a required element of study participation.</p>
         <div class="section-title">Compensation</div>
         <p>You will be compensated $50 CAD for each year you remain in the study. This is defined as participation in the annual surveys and interviews. If you participate in only the survey but withdraw prior to the interview, you will be compensated $10 for that year. If you participate in only the interview but do not participate in the survey, you will be compensated $40 for that year. Total compensation will be a maximum of $200 CAD for participants who participate in all four study milestones (entry, end yr 1, end yr 2, end yr 3). You will be paid annually. If you choose to withdraw from the study, you will still be compensated for the study milestones in which you participated.</p>
         <div class="section-title">Confidentiality</div>
         <p>Protecting your privacy is our first priority. Only the research team will have access to any information that could identify you, including your name, contact information, Twitter, LinkedIn, and/or ArtStation profiles, and information about your employer and position. This is called ‘identifying information’, and it will be removed from our dataset before we move the information from our secure database. An anonymized version of the data will be shared with our research partners, the Higher Education Video Game Alliance (<a href="see www.hevga.org" target="_blank">HEVGA</a>), the Education group of the International Game Developers Association (<a href=" https://igda.org/sigs/game-education/" target="_blank">IGDA</a>), and the International Game Developers Association Foundation (<a href="https://igdafoundation.org/" target="_blank">IGDAF</a>). The anonymized version of our data will not include any information that could be used to identify you, and some potentially identifying information may be made more general so that it provides information without specifics (for example, rather than the name of your employer, we might say ‘large AAA game studio’, or ‘small indie’). These organizations will receive a dataset that includes statistical summaries from the anonymized social media analysis, general demographic information, and statistical summaries of employment trends amongst graduates. No identifying information will be passed along.</p>
         <p>Please note that the survey data is collected through the confidential online program “REDCap”, which houses its data on servers located in Canada and is subject to laws in that country as related to privacy and access to information.</p>
         <p>Only the research team will have access to the information collected in this project. Your name will not appear in any reports of this research. You have a right to review a copy of any survey, questionnaire, checklist, etc. that is being administered and we will send you a copy of your data each year of the study.</p>
         <p>Any research assistants involved with this project will comply with the University of Alberta Standards for the Protection of Human Research Participants.</p>
         <p>Any other research personnel (e.g., transcribers) will be required to sign a confidentiality agreement that prohibits them from conveying any details about the data collected during this project to anyone other than the research team members for this project.</p>
         <div class="section-title">Risks</div>
         <p>Participation in this project is voluntary and involves no unusual risks to you. You may rescind your permission at any time with no negative consequences. You can refuse to participate or withdraw from the project at any time with no negative consequences. We will not disclose your participation in the project. You may disclose your participation in the project at any time (on social media for example), though such a course of action may increase public awareness of comments made about employment in the industry.<p>
         <div class="section-title">Data Use, Storage and Withdrawal</div>
         <p>Data will be kept for 7 years following completion of the research study and will remain in secure storage during that time. You are entitled to a copy of the final report of this study. Results from this research study may be used for research articles, presentations, and teaching purposes. For all uses, data will be handled in compliance with the University Standards.</p>
         <p>Each year you will have the opportunity to withdraw any or all of your data for that year from the study. After we send you a copy of your yearly data you will have 30 days to tell us if you wish to withdraw any of it. After that point, your data for the year cannot be withdrawn. Withdrawal of data in one year does not prohibit you from continuing your participation in other years.</p>
         <div class="section-title">Summary</div>
         <p>There are several very clear rights that you are entitled to as a participant in any research conducted by a researcher from the University of Alberta. You have the right:</p>
         <p>
           <ul>
             <li>To not participate.</li>
             <li>To withdraw at any time without prejudice to pre-existing entitlements, and to continuing and meaningful opportunities for deciding whether or not to continue to participate.</li>
             <li>To opt out without penalty and any collected data withdrawn from the database and not included in the study.</li>
             <li>To privacy, anonymity, and confidentiality.</li>
             <li>To safeguards for security of data (data are to be kept for a minimum of 7 years following completion of research).</li>
             <li>To disclosure of the presence of any apparent or actual conflict of interest on the part of the researcher(s) to the participant.</li>
             <li>To a copy of any final report that may be a result of the collected data.</li>
           </ul>
         </p>
